#Browse API

#<p>The Browse API has the following resources:</p>   <ul> <li><b>item_summary: </b> Lets shoppers search for specific items by keyword, GTIN, category, charity, product, or item aspects and refine the results by using filters.</li>  <li> <a href=\"https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/versioning.html#API\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/cms/img/docs/experimental-icon.svg\" class=\"legend-icon experimental-icon\" alt=\"Experimental Release\" title=\"Experimental Release\" />&nbsp;(Experimental)</a> <b>search_by_image: </b> Lets shoppers search for specific items by image. You can refine the results by using URI parameters and filters.</li>   <li><b> item: </b> <ul><li>Lets you retrieve the details of a specific item or all the items in an item group, which is an item with variations such as color and size.</li> <li>Lets you check if a product is compatible with the specified item, such as if a specific car is compatible with a specific part.</li> <li>Provides a bridge between the eBay legacy APIs, such as <b>Trading</b> and <b>Finding</b>, and the RESTful APIs, such as <b>Browse</b>, which use different formats for the item IDs enabling you to retrieve the details of the item and the RESTful item ID using a legacy item ID.</li>  </ul> </li>  <li><a href=\"https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/versioning.html#API\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"/cms/img/docs/experimental-icon.svg\" class=\"legend-icon experimental-icon\" alt=\"Experimental Release\" title=\"Experimental Release\" />&nbsp;(Experimental)</a> <b>shopping_cart: </b> Provides the ability for eBay members to see the contents of their eBay cart, and add, remove, and change the quantity of items in their eBay cart.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Note: </b> This resource is not available in the eBay API Explorer.</li></ul>       <p>The <b>item_summary</b>, <b>search_by_image</b>, and <b>item</b> resource calls require an <a href=\"/api-docs/static/oauth-client-credentials-grant.html\">Application access token</a>.

# The following  was generated by the `rspec --init` command. Conventionally, all
# specs live under a `spec` directory, which RSpec adds to the `$LOAD_PATH`.
# The generated `.rspec` file contains `--require spec_helper` which will cause
# this file to always be loaded, without a need to explicitly require it in any
# files.
#
# Given that it is always loaded, you are encouraged to keep this file as
# light-weight as possible. Requiring heavyweight dependencies from this file
# will add to the boot time of your test suite on EVERY test run, even for an
# individual file that may not need all of that loaded. Instead, consider making
# a separate helper file that requires the additional dependencies and performs
# the additional setup, and require it from the spec files that actually need
# it.
#
# The `.rspec` file also contains a few flags that are not defaults but that
# users commonly want.
#
# See http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Configuration

    # and `failure_message` of custom matchers include text for helper methods
    # defined using `chain`, e.g.:
    #     be_bigger_than(2).and_smaller_than(4).description
    #     # => "be bigger than 2 and smaller than 4"
    # ...rather than:
    #     # => "be bigger than 2"

  # library (such as bogus or mocha) by changing the `mock_with` option here.
