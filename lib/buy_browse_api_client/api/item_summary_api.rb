    # This method searches for eBay items by various query parameters and retrieves summaries of the items. You can search by keyword, category, eBay product ID (ePID), or GTIN, charity ID, or a combination of these. Note: Only FIXED_PRICE (Buy It Now) items are returned. However, the method does return items where both FIXED_PRICE and AUCTION are available as a buying option. But after a bid has been placed, that item becomes an active auction item and is no longer returned. This method also supports the following: Filtering by the value of one or multiple fields, such as listing format, item condition, price range, location, and more. For the fields supported by this method, see the filter parameter. Retrieving the refinements (metadata) of an item , such as item aspects (color, brand), condition, category, etc. using the fieldgroups parameter. Filtering by item aspects and other refinements using the aspect_filter parameter. Creating aspects histograms, which enables shoppers to drill down in each refinement narrowing the search results. For details and examples of these capabilities, see Browse API in the Buying Integration Guide. Pagination and sort controls There are pagination controls (limit and offset fields) and sort query parameters that control/sort the data that is returned. By default, the results are sorted by &quot;Best Match&quot;. For more information about Best Match, see the eBay help page Best Match. URLs for this method Production URL: https://api.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/ Sandbox URL: https://api.sandbox.ebay.com/buy/browse/v1/item_summary/ Request headers You will want to use the X-EBAY-C-ENDUSERCTX request header with this method. This header enables eBay Network Partners to pass in their identification in order to be paid for selling eBay items and it is strongly recommended you use contextualLocation to improve the estimated delivery window information. For details see, Request headers in the Buying Integration Guide. Restrictions This method can return a maximum of 10,000 items. For a list of supported sites and other restrictions, see API Restrictions.
    # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
    # @option opts [String] :aspect_filter This field lets you filter by item aspects. The aspect name/value pairs and category, which is required, is used to limit the results to specific aspects of the item. For example, in a clothing category one aspect pair would be Color/Red. For example, the method below uses the category ID for Women&#39;s Clothing. This will return only items for a woman&#39;s red shirt. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q&#x3D;shirt&amp;amp;category_ids&#x3D;15724&amp;amp;aspect_filter&#x3D;categoryId:15724,Color:{Red} To get a list of the aspects pairs and the category, which is returned in the dominantCategoryId field, set fieldgroups to ASPECT_REFINEMENTS. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q&#x3D;shirt&amp;amp;fieldgroups&#x3D;ASPECT_REFINEMENTS Required: The category ID is required twice; once as a URI parameter and as part of the aspect_filter. For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/devzone/rest/api-ref/browse/types/AspectFilter.html
    # @option opts [String] :category_ids The category ID is used to limit the results. This field can have one category ID or a comma separated list of IDs. For example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?category_ids&#x3D;29792 Note: Currently, you can pass in only one category ID. You can also use any combination of the category_Ids, epid, and q fields. This gives you additional control over the result set. For example, let&#39;s say you are looking of a toy phone. If you search for &amp;quot;phone&amp;quot;, the result set will be mobile phones because this is the &amp;quot;Best Match&amp;quot; for this search. But if you also include the toy category ID, the results will be what you wanted. For example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q&#x3D;phone&amp;amp;category_ids&#x3D;220 The list of eBay category IDs is not published and category IDs are not the same across all the eBay marketplaces. You can use the following techniques to find a category by site: Use the Category Changes page. Use the Taxonomy API. For details see Get Categories for Buy APIs. Submit the following method to get the dominantCategoryId for an item. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q&#x3D;keyword&amp;amp;fieldgroups&#x3D;ASPECT_REFINEMENTS Note: If a top-level (L1) category is specified, you must also include the q query parameter. Required: The method must have category_ids, epid, gtin, or q (or any combination of these)
    # @option opts [String] :charity_ids The charity ID is used to limit the results to only items associated with the specified charity. This field can have one charity ID or a comma separated list of IDs. The method will return all the items associated with the specified charities. For example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?charity_ids&#x3D;13-1788491,300108469 The charity ID is the charity&#39;s registration ID, also known as the Employer Identification Number (EIN). In GB, it is the Charity Registration Number (CRN), commonly called &amp;quot;Charity Number&amp;quot;. To find the charities eBay supports, you can search for a charity at Charity Search or go to Charity Shop. To find the charity ID of a specific charity, click on a charity and use the EIN number. For example, the charity ID for American Red Cross, is 530196605. You can also use any combination of the category_Ids and q fields with a charity_Ids to filter the result set. This gives you additional control over the result set. Restriction: This is supported only on the US and GB marketplaces. Maximum: 20 IDs Required: One ID
    # @option opts [String] :epid The ePID is the eBay product identifier of a product from the eBay product catalog. This field limits the results to only items in the specified ePID. The Marketing API getMerchandisedProducts method and the Browse API getItem, getItemByLegacyId, and getItemsByItemGroup calls return the ePID of the product. You can also use the product_summary/search method in the Catalog API to search for the ePID of the product. For example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?epid&#x3D;15032 Maximum: 1 Required: The method must have category_ids, epid, gtin, or q (or any combination of these)
    # @option opts [String] :fieldgroups This field is a comma separated list of values that lets you control what is returned in the response. The default is MATCHING_ITEMS, which returns the items that match the keyword or category specified. The other values return data that can be used to create histograms or provide additional information. Valid Values: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS - This returns the aspectDistributions container, which has the dominantCategoryId, matchCount, and refinementHref for the various aspects of the items found. For example, if you searched for &#39;Mustang&#39;, some of the aspect would be Model Year, Exterior Color, Vehicle Mileage, etc. Note: ASPECT_REFINEMENTS are category specific. BUYING_OPTION_REFINEMENTS - This returns the buyingOptionDistributions container, which has the matchCount and refinementHref for AUCTION and FIXED_PRICE (Buy It Now) items. Note: Classified items are not supported and only &amp;quot;Buy It Now&amp;quot; (non-auction) items are returned. CATEGORY_REFINEMENTS - This returns the categoryDistributions container, which has the categories that the item is in. CONDITION_REFINEMENTS - This returns the conditionDistributions container, such as NEW, USED, etc. Within these groups are multiple states of the condition. For example, New can be New without tag, New in box, New without box, etc. EXTENDED - Returns the shortDescription field, which provides condition and item aspect information and the itemLocation.city field. MATCHING_ITEMS - This is meant to be used with one or more of the refinement values above. You use this to return the specified refinements and all the matching items. FULL - This returns all the refinement containers and all the matching items. Code so that your app gracefully handles any future changes to this list. Default: MATCHING_ITEMS
    # @option opts [String] :filter This field supports multiple field filters that can be used to limit/customize the result set. For example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q&#x3D;shirt&amp;amp;filter&#x3D;price:[10..50] You can also combine filters. /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?q&#x3D;shirt&amp;amp;filter&#x3D;price:[10..50],sellers:{rpseller|bigSal} The following are the supported filters. For details and examples for all the filters, see Buy API Field Filters. buyingOptions charityOnly conditionIds conditions deliveryCountry deliveryOptions deliveryPostalCode excludeCategoryIds excludeSellers itemEndDate itemLocationCountry itemStartDate paymentMethods pickupCountry pickupPostalCode pickupRadius pickupRadiusUnit price priceCurrency maxDeliveryCost (free shipping) returnsAccepted sellerAccountTypes sellers For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/devzone/rest/api-ref/browse/types/FilterField.html
    # @option opts [String] :gtin This field lets you search by the Global Trade Item Number of the item as defined by http://www.gtin.info. This can be a UPC (Universal Product Code), EAN (European Article Number), or an ISBN (International Standard Book Number) value. For example: /buy/browse/v1/item_summary/search?gtin&#x3D;099482432621 Maximum: 1 Required: The method must have category_ids, epid, gtin, or q (or any combination of these)
    # @option opts [String] :limit The number of items, from the result set, returned in a single page. Default: 50 Maximum number of items per page (limit): 200 Maximum number of items in a result set: 10,000
    # @option opts [String] :offset Specifies the number of items to skip in the result set. This is used with the limit field to control the pagination of the output. If offset is 0 and limit is 10, the method will retrieve items 1-10 from the list of items returned, if offset is 10 and limit is 10, the method will retrieve items 11 thru 20 from the list of items returned. Valid Values: 0-10,000 (inclusive) Default: 0 Maximum number of items returned: 10,000
    # @option opts [String] :q A string consisting of one or more keywords that are used to search for items on eBay. The keywords are handled as follows: If the keywords are separated by a comma, it is treated as an AND. In the following example, the query returns items that have iphone AND ipad. /buy/browse/v1_beta/item_summary/search?q&#x3D;iphone,ipad If the keywords are separated by a space, it is treated as an OR. In the following examples, the query returns items that have iphone OR ipad. /buy/browse/v1_beta/item_summary/search?q&#x3D;iphone&amp;nbsp;ipad /buy/browse/v1_beta/item_summary/search?q&#x3D;iphone,&amp;nbsp;ipad Restriction: The * wildcard character is not allowed in this field. Required: The method must have category_ids, epid, gtin, or q (or any combination of these)
    # @option opts [String] :sort Specifies the order and the field name to use to sort the items. To sort in descending order use - before the field name. Currently, you can only sort by price (in ascending or descending order), or by distance (only applicable if the &amp;quot;pickup&amp;quot; filters are used, and only ascending order is supported). If no sort parameter is submitted, the result set is sorted by &amp;quot;Best Match&amp;quot;. The following are examples of using the sort query parameter. Sort Result sort&#x3D;price Sorts by price in ascending order (lowest price first) sort&#x3D;-price Sorts by price in descending order (highest price first) sort&#x3D;distance Sorts by distance in ascending order (shortest distance first) Default: ascending For implementation help, refer to eBay API documentation at https://developer.ebay.com/devzone/rest/api-ref/browse/types/SortField.html
